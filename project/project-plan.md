# Project Plan

## Exploring the Correlation Between Unemployment and Crime Rates in G7 Nations and India Over Two Decades (2000-2020)

<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing the impact of unemployment on the crime rate for G7 nations and India requires collecting and examining data from two different datasets: one on unemployment rates and another on crime rates. The correlation between these two variables can provide insights into the relationship between unemployment and crime. 

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Determine the strength and direction of the correlation between unemployment and crime.
2. If there's correlation or causation
3. Whether the relationship between unemployment and crime varies across different geographic area

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to investigate the relationship between unemployment and its potential impact on crime rate. It combines data from two different open data sources: unemployment data and crime rate data.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each data source you plan to use in a section. Use the prefix "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the data source. -->

### Datasource1: Unemployment rates
